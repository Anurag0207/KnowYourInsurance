# Insurance Prediction Model
## Overview
The Insurance Prediction Model is a machine learning model built using PyTorch to predict insurance charges based on various input features such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region. This model aims to provide accurate predictions of insurance charges, which can be valuable for insurance companies and individuals alike.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found here. It consists of information about individuals, including their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and insurance charges.

## Model Architecture
The Insurance Prediction Model is a simple linear regression model implemented using PyTorch. It consists of a single linear layer that takes the input features and predicts the insurance charges.

## Training
The model is trained using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer. The training process involves iterating over the dataset for a specified number of epochs, computing the loss, and updating the model parameters to minimize the loss.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the validation dataset. The evaluation metric used is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the model's predictions and the actual insurance charges. Lower MSE indicates better performance.
